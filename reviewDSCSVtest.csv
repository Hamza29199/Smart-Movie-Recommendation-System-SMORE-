Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet and Costner's character are realized early on and then forgotten until much later by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.,0
"Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to ""take care of their mother"" and how they cope when their new stepfather begins beating the younger boy. The supporting cast around the boys is top-notch as well. The script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe Wood could grow up to look anything like Tom Hanks but that's nothing new in Hollywood. That's honestly my only criticism of the film.",1
"You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting but it's far from that. Take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. It's just like Hannah Montana and That's So Raven. Next the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly the jokes are either clich√© or boring. If they're not using they're colorful yet strange dialog to make us ""laugh"" they are throwing various props around the room. I really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material. In conclusion Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.",0
"You got it right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend through the whole movie even at the beginning when on their way to California. His mother knew of Bobby and didn't discourage Mike leaning on Bobby since imaginary friends are common with young children.<br /><br />That's why they both got stomach aches at the same time. That's why the boys' were so close.<br /><br />At the end Mike was letting Bobby go. The ""King"" was arrested. Mike could go on without Bobby. It's also why Mike's mother didn't seem disturbed when Mike received the postcard (Mike had written & mailed) from Bobby the Ol' West tourist stop and the other postcards from all over the world. You noticed Mike's mother turned the first card over and looked at the postmark. What a great mom doing the best she could in the late sixties.<br /><br />A 9 out of 10 for me. Brought back memories...",1
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. The first one had an original story the second stole one from King Kong and in the end (I hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was about all there was to it. The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. If you have a discount theatre in your local area wait and see it for a buck. I wouldn't even bother renting it. That would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller.,0
"You can tell that this is the first offering by the Director (who also wrote it) but you can also see the potential this guy has. This is an obviously low budget film in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course Boondock Saints came out a few years after this so you could look at this as a diamond in need of some polish. The acting was good - if you're looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a crime drama remember that these are young guys playing young guys trying to be criminals. They're not going to be ""supercool"" (tm) like some of the veterans. I would have love to have seen Justin Pagel (Joe - the main character) go on to make more movies - he was great in this. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.",1
"Yesterday I watched this tv production and I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production but the complete movie was pain with no ending. I felt it lasted for 3 hours but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the ""turn off""-switch.<br /><br />The movie is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets a lot of AIDS-patients and most of them die during the movie. It is hard for Verghese to live with so his family gets punished with his frustrations. However this movie has problems showing both sides it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients and sometimes we see flicks from his home but we don't get much. The difficulties to show more than one part of Verghese's life doesn't get any better with the poor acting from Naveen Andrews a man I (hopefully) can't see in any good future movies.<br /><br />I believe it got 76 because of the subject (taboo?) but I'm sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market. Stay away from this movie it does not deserve more than 3/10.<br /><br />",0
Yes. Bam cried a couple times and so did Englund. And most probably you will too. The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed-up retards (I mean this in the best possible way). I first thought maybe Bam or Steve-O were the main go-to guys....nope the main man is now Johnny. Don't get me wrong everybody and I mean everybody is great in this flick! Right from the get-go you're laughing and believe you me don't plan on resting that smile of yours. I personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first. You know when you go into a theater and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it.....well this movie blows all expectations away. If you love Jackass you can go into this with gigantic expectations. No matter what you'll laugh your ass off. If you're not laughing the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating Jack Sh!t for breakfast and Jack left town. All I have to say is prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie. :),1
"Years ago I didn't love and respect the films of Jimmy Cagney nearly as much as I do now. I noticed that many of Cagney's films done with Warner Brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle. However the more I watched these films the more I found I was hooked despite these aspects. In fact I now kind of like and expect them! Fans of old time Hollywood films probably understand what I am saying--teens and other young whippersnappers don't! Well when it comes to entertainment THE MAYOR OF HELL never lets up from start to finish. While the idea of a shady character like Cagney played taking over running a reform school is ridiculous and while all the changes he made also seemed far-fetched it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment.<br /><br />The gang of tough thugs were pre-Dead End Kids and instead of the likes of Leo Gorcey Huntz Hall and Billy Hallop similar roles are played here by Frankie Darrow and Farina. Yes I did say ""Farina"". This Black actor was already famous for his roles in the Our Gang comedies and was believe it or not one of the highest paid child actors in Hollywood. All he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical ""Negro"". Here he actually was pretty good and the usual Black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual. However some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving Farina and his dad Fred 'Snowflake' Toones. With awful names like ""Farina"" and ""Snowflake"" don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />Apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe the film is exceptional and fun. The kids do a great job as does Cagney and Dudley Digges in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden. Also as an added plus you get to see perennial Warner stock actor Allen Jenkins in his first role for the studio.",1
"Wow... just... wow. There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own. I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing - whoo boy does it ever. However I think there is some other problems here.<br /><br />1. Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? The film acts as though you just can't be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Why? They ever-so-briefly touch on this in the film (i.e. ""The Bible doesn't say there is aliens."" ""Well the Bible doesn't say there isn't.) but the actual rebuttal is never answered. The Bible really doesn't say there isn't. So how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand? Or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for them.<br /><br />2. How come the ONLY two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax? What about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences? What if it's something else entirely? Too bad the film makers already have their minds made up.<br /><br />3. The film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult. That's a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present. I'm not necessarily arguing that they don't but if you're going to say something so asinine you'd better have the facts to back it up.<br /><br />4. Why does the other reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy the other one) always have his hands in his pockets? It's hard to take someone seriously when they're constantly playing pocket pool.<br /><br />I WISH this had been an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their ""Faith Message"" to care much about make a thought provoking movie. As a Christian myself this saddens me.",0
Wow! i think they made this movie to torture people. there are no words for how much i hated this film. I could have been cleaning my room instead. i love bad melodrama as much as the next person but....come on!,0
"Wow was this version of THE RACKETEER tough to watch! While none of the other reviews have mentioned this the public domain version I watched was seriously flawed. The sound track was off by about 10 seconds--meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching. So you'd hear something occur well before you saw it--a very confusing proposition! The worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi.<br /><br />While this seriously marred the film it also made concentrating on the dialog easier--and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well. The dialog was simply awful--often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. As one review said it was like watching a high school play. Part of this is understandable as sound was a new medium but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films--really bad. And like many of these early sound films the film was just too talky--with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. And you'd THINK with a title like ""The Racketeer"" that there would be some action!! However it's really a sappy romance--with very little action.<br /><br />The film finds Carol Lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician. She herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him--and the crook Robert Armstrong comes to her assistance. When Armstrong catches her cheating at cards he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet--and naturally he falls for her in the process. The problem is that once the drunk sobers up he too wants Lombard and she needs to choose between them. Wow...a recovering drunk or a mobster...talk about a couple great prospects! Overall it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print I saw. However even if you ignore this the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature. And...it was sappy too boot.",0
Wow I was really disappointed. I wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater and I wish I stuck to that plan. It really should be a made-for-tv movie. I was kind of excited to see it as I'm a big fan of Fairuza Balk but this movie didn't do her justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. What a horrible cover up of Fairuza Balk's tattoos it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder. <br /><br />There was no flow to the movie it was very hard to get into it. One scene we get angry hyped up we want blood the anticipation rises just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby. It would have been more enjoyable to follow if it was broken up into three sectional sunday paper comic strip.<br /><br />There was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts. The gangster leaders were scrawny guys not very believable. Matt Dillon head of a mobster organization? Come on give me a break. There was just no intimidation there. <br /><br />The soundtrack.. wow. I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard. What awful guitar solos my god. The sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends I'm sure. <br /><br />Anyhow there is one positive comment I'd like to make about the movie. The settings were nicely done. I liked the colours a good job conveying that time period.,0
Wow I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.<br /><br />Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt lillard granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk another great Lillard film.<br /><br />Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent D'onofrio a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)<br /><br />It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.<br /><br />The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway.,1
"Wow here is another great golf movie. That's at least three in the past few years that I've really enjoyed that were well-done beautifully-filmed and inspirational. The other two were ""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" and ""The Legend Of Bagger Vance.""<br /><br />This is a true underdog story if there ever was one. To have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament is an unheard-of feat. I believe this is the only time in the 100 years it has ever been accomplished. How much of this film is fiction embellished for dramatic effect I don't know. I do know that I plan on reading the book and I know that in real-life Francis Ouimet had a three-stroke lead in playoff with just two holes to go unlike what we saw in the film.<br /><br />Whatever. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is fact. It is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It isn't something just for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Kudso to actor-turned-director Bill Paxton for an outstanding job.<br /><br />Yes a lot of this is just plain golf but there are subplots such as Ouimet's relationship with his father and with a pretty young woman who is obviously interested in him. It's also a touching story of someone giving a little kid a chance. The movie also deals with Vardon's demons of coming from the wrong side of the tracks and trying to make it in an elitist's sport which it was at the time for both Europeans and Americans.<br /><br />Shia LaBeouf is winsome as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day maybe even more unbeatable. In the film Vardon is pictured as a warm nice guy; a genuine human being. the other major competitor Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy. <br /><br />The fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who winds up being Ouimet's caddie in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie.<br /><br />If all of this - a playoff with the huge underdog against two mighty pros and having come down to the last hole - were not true you would think ""Oh man this is so hokey. Who could believe this?"" That's what makes this true-life story fun to see finally captured on film. As with another sports film of 2005 - ""Cinderella Man"" - here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards. I guess nice films don't win awards.....just the hearts of their viewers.",1
"Wow ""The Curse of Michael Myers"" what a great film. Suspenseful entertaining creative and a clever plot which I love. Many hate the 'Thorn' concept I love it. I think that it gives the Halloween series some plot. Marianne Hagan is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance especially for her first film and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence are great also. My only complaint is that why wasn't Danielle Harris in this film as Jamie? She wanted to return but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great but I love Danielle Harris. Still I love Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. I think The Shape's mask looks the best in this film and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers ever. Incredibly creepy and suspenseful Halloween 6 rules! <br /><br />I adore this very violent but immensely enjoyable film. The Halloween horror series - by far the best in the Genre.<br /><br />10 out of 10.",1
Worst pile of drivel to date! Everyone involved with this production should be ashamed of themselves. Not one single element of the movie was anything slightly like an original idea. A first grader telling you a story about nap time is more entertaining.,0
Worst movie ever seen. Worst acting too. I cannot imagine a movie worse then this. Nothing to see. No acting at all.T hey (actors) should look for another job. I cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie.<br /><br />I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. Must be tough...I cannot imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!<br /><br />The ladies in the movie...perhaps they better stick to XXX.<br /><br />As for the LEADING MAN...what a lead! He better be put on a lead and stay there! I can see him being more successful at barking rather than acting. <br /><br />Overall rating: Do NOt rent...DO NOT BUY!,0
With its ww2 timing falling in and out of love and easy on the eye Kira this is re-Atonement. <br /><br />This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. <br /><br />Vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace. Would work well with French subtitles but then I may have been to too many art house movies lately.,1
"William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice is about a Jewish moneylender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio the forfeiter of a debt. The Jewish moneylender of course is Shylock and he is given such a towering performance by Al Pacino that even outstanding actors like Jeremy Irons Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins fade into the background. The film is set in 16th century Venice and director Michael Radford relies on setting mood and realism to tell its story rejecting lavish period costumes or a modern setting with rock music to appeal to a wider audience.<br /><br />Radford slices the play's three-hour length to a manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background. In the opening narration he tells us how Jews came to England were subject to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property could make profits only by lending money at interest and were forced to live in a Venetian ""geto"" a forerunner of darker events to come. In the film the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spits upon Shylock in public yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested lover Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to properly court Portia (Lynne Collins) a wealthy heiress. Though Shylock has been insulted by Antonio he agrees to loan the money without interest for three months on the condition that forfeiture of the bond grants him the right to exact a pound of flesh from Antonio's heart.<br /><br />The play is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge but like many of Shakespeare's works there are touches of broad comedy as well. Here the comedy involves three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia Gratiano Bassanio's friend and Nerissa and Lorenzo another friend of Bassanio and Jessica Shylock's daughter. Portia has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses the one of gold the Prince of Aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed. Bassanio however loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within. Radford's adaptation conveys a remarkable feeling for time and place. Portia's residence at Belmont suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the grungy look of Shylock's city with its dank alleyways.<br /><br />When it becomes clear that Antonio cannot repay the debt Bassanio returns to Venice leaving Portia behind. When he arrives the loan is in default and Shylock is demanding his pound of flesh. Even when Bassanio backed by Portia's wealth offers many times the amount in repayment Shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for a lifetime of outsider status. The duke who sits in judgment will not intervene as Portia enters in the guise as a lawyer to defend Antonio. It is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve a final resolution.<br /><br />The Merchant of Venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of Jews from Christian society and their desire for belonging. It has been one of Shakespeare's most controversial plays and analysts have debated for a long time whether it is an anti-Semitic play or simply a play about anti-Semitism that reflects the prevalent view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that Shakespeare views his flaws as human failings not Jewish ones. The Duke recognizes that he is simply a man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the Torah.<br /><br />In the monologue ""I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? ¬ÖIf you prick us do we not bleed? if you tickle us do we not laugh? if you poison us do we not die? and if you wrong us shall we not revenge?"" Shylock shows a universal humanity expressing the equality of all men. Though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out we can feel his pain accumulated over the years. Pacino's performance brings new vigor to the text and his often over-the-top persona is replaced with a gentler more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause.. During a Toronto International Film Festival interview last September Radford said about Pacino ""¬Öwhen you work with a brilliant actor you have a great machine. It's a bit like driving a powerful car. You have to dare to do it."" He has dared and we are all the beneficiaries.",1
"William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable --and most often read -- creations provide us with wistful humor gentle poetry and hilarious slapstick. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity. Regardless he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness contributing greatly to our young language. So in what category lies The Merchant of Venice ? I was very surprised to find it is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I had never before read it nor seen it but after watching this most recent film version I have decided it is neither and it is both. This is one of many questions the viewer must try to answer when coming to terms with what is clearly a perplexing and deeply troubling moral tragedy.<br /><br />The players are introduced quickly and simply. One of them firstly is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the actual city creating an impressively vibrant bustling backdrop to the play's proceedings. To this scenery enters the youthful Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) returning to Venice to see a dear old friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems the poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father has died and has left to any potential suitors a lottery of sorts. Waiting at the fair lady's island estate are three small trunks <br /><br />only one of which contains ""images of the princess"". He who can guess the right one using only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written upon them will be bestowed the father's huge fortune for life. Oh and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage I forgot to mention. Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the movie. This farcical plot element drives the story and also fills up much of the film's screen time as a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive at the island humorously vying for and failing to earn this very wealthy hand in marriage. But before any of this occurs Bassanio very much lacking in finances entreats Antonio to loan him three thousand ducats to pay for the lengthy journey he must take to have his shot at the prize. <br /><br />Antonio himself nearly penniless must reluctantly embrace humility by seeking the financial aid of Shylock (Al Pacino) one of countless Jewish usurers who keep the sagging economy afloat yet are scorned and persecuted to no end by the city's zealously Christian majority. Thus they dwell in society's underbelly and it is here the two borrowers must go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident where Antonio insulted and spat on him in the city market and he proudly rebukes this man who frankly has a lot of nerve now coming to ask for help. But help him Shylock does. He even erases any kind of interest on the loan most likely feeling he has no reason to be concerned if Antonio will be able to repay him within three months. Still Shylock's one contractual demand is a pound of Antonio's flesh should he renege on their agreement. This is an unsettling request to be sure for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. But it appears that despite his justifiable pride Shylock does not really anticipate seeing such a gruesome act occurring. <br /><br />So here the dramatic groundwork has been laid. And while the film goes off to explore its gentler side with its love lottery and mistaken identities there still looms the gloomy prospect of the loan itself. In the end what will become of this ominous agreement? Meanwhile we are left at turns to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here and he does so with convincing grit and passion. There are times when he is given room for the theatrics we have come to expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are the ones where he internalizes this energy showing a conflicted personality: honest sincere and proud yet brooding vengeful and entirely remorseless. This is one of Pacino's most heartfelt performances to date. And while the rest of the cast play their roles creditably and convincingly it is Pacino who really owns the film -- especially toward the end when Shakespeare upends this seeming romantic comedy with a wallop of a third act.<br /><br />I shall not reveal much here; all I can say is that it involves the initial loan -- a mighty shoe one expected would drop sooner or later. And does it ever. By the end Shakespeare has raised a host of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly unresolvable questions of faith morality law and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes and while by curtain's close the playwright's position may seem clear to some we are left completely at odds. There are winners and losers in this one but have the winners earned their spoils with good reason or have they in a larger sense ended out losing as well? Has virtue been rewarded or simply flouted? Has justice in fact this time been just? By the play's finish some fates are painfully clear and unequivocally sealed. But the audience are to be the ones who really decide the verdict for all of those involved. And for some the verdict is still out for the play as well. Comedy or tragedy? The author has cunningly veiled the intense courtroom finale with an ending of light mirth and pat romantic resolutions. Is he saying that all is well that ends well or is this his final ironic condemnation? The play's humor serves to set us up nicely for such a heavy crash. And while it is also what unfortunately keeps The Merchant of Venice from achieving the greatness of so many of Shakespeare's other works it is still engaging amusing and thought-provoking beyond measure.",1
"William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice portrays 16th century Venice. Al Pacino plays Shylock a Jewish loan shark who plots revenge on a Catholic that has looked down on him. The movie is a slow moving plot in the beginning that builds up throughout the two plus hours. The film gives a very good and believe appearance to it's characters especially Pacino. When hearing that Pacino plays a Jew one might think that it would not work looking at Pacino's previous mobster type movie roles. Nonetheless it works very well credit must be given to the costume designer's and director's of the film. The look of all the characters fits well with the time period the play takes place in. The costumes look like the Renaissance appearance one might envision to be.<br /><br />The film portrays a very anti-Semitic vibe. From the first minute to the last it is shown how the Catholic's try to take advantage of the Jews in every way they can even to the point of keeping them locked away in ""ghettos"" and not allowing them to regular jobs. In comparison to The Passion of the Christ another recent film that people believed to be very Anti-Semitic Merchant of Venice makes Passion look like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews or at least Shylock wanted revenge for the mistreatment that the Jews received. The location shots also seem very timely and the scenery is at times very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film making it just that much more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be seen as anti-Semitic because the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics.<br /><br />Although the film clearly attempts to have a serious aura certain parts do add a bit of humor to the act. The oh so serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds a bit of humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) come into the trial and decide who will be the victor and the defeated. That in itself might not be funny but seeing it that they were women dressed up in disguise as men one might find it to be pretty amusing. The whole cross dressing scene as compelling as it was could have probably been even more memorable had the make up artists and director Michael Radford taken notice that the two women still look like women and could easily be recognized. The director also could have seen into the fact that the women are speaking through their regular voices instead of trying to sound like men which in part takes away from the scene but doesn't kill it entirely.<br /><br />Overall the film gets a 7 out of 10",1
Why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS directed by the brilliant Sydney Pollack (who has a small role in the film too) is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such it is quite good and entertaining. Surely anyone who goes to see it has this in mind or read the book which is no better. Even Kristin Scott Thomas fans myself included knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her eldest uncle. Even as such the film is satisfying. What's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other (much higher rated) Harrison Ford vehicles? This film is no masterpiece but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe.,1
While the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film I could have stopped there and gone on with my life. She does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.<br /><br />I also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. If a guy said a filthy comment grabbed her or made some disgusting gesture to her I would say go for it bring him down he's a pig. What bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it.<br /><br />I think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are. Guys will look at beautiful women especially when they dress provocatively just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all.<br /><br />Some women may hate me for this but I hope not. I have much respect for women. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family for years but I don't really feel this did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself some women were offended by her project.,0
While it would be easy and accurate to go into why 'Reba' is at its heart indicative of many 'family-oriented sitcoms' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms the real truth is that the show is repetitive full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows and the lead star is completely out of her element. While I'm sure Ms. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports that being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is far far removed from reality.<br /><br />Reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put-upon woman of which her entire family is centered. Yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character. I could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence and to make a show around her seems very short-sighted and indicative of most 'family-oriented' programming: to push a sitcom full of men-stupid/women-do-everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can't afford cable.<br /><br />The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard PAX ripoff....just.,0
"Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.<br /><br />But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas the roistering free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39) who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters in which three old maids in a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother. All that is now forgiven.<br /><br />In John Maybury's The Edge of Love Thomas is played by the Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It's not a full-scale biopic. The film covers four years in the poet's life during World War II when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and a former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley) whom he met again by chance during the war. It seems he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women -- to Thomas and to each other -- is at the heart of Maybury's absorbing film.<br /><br />How it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson the film's producer is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William a war hero (played in the film by Cillian Murphy) married Vera while she was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents Dylan Thomas: A Farm Two Mansions and Bungalow by David Thomas describing their tangled lives. Sharman Macdonald who wrote the screenplay is the mother of Knightley. The part requires Knightley to sing and her mother included songs especially for her. Surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeed.<br /><br />We begin in London during the Blitz. Bombs are falling sirens are wailing and Phillips is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground Tube station. In a pub by chance she meets Thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs listening to Thomas read his poems exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off as everyone did in wartime. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world (""My first was Augustus John he seduced me when I was 15""). But it's the refined and soulful Phillips who stirs Thomas's deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms. In the meantime she has reluctantly married Killick who has seen her in the Tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her singing).<br /><br />It is an intense and strangely beautiful film though Thomas himself may be its least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub whose name spelt backwards was not something polite English teachers drew attention to. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton reading the poem (he appeared in a film of Under Milk Wood in 1971) and I've never forgotten the creamy seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma the magnetism of the man is something I missed in Rhys's performance. Thomas comes across as a strangely pallid even secondary figure compared with the women in his life.<br /><br />In his previous film Love Is the Devil Maybury explored the turbulent life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model George Dyer. The Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights it offers into the springs of Thomas's creative inspiration I would have to say Llareggub. But as an insight into his egotism his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others it is wonderfully sad and revealing.<br /><br />Thomas had a good war boozing and writing while other men (including Killick) were being traumatised by the horrors of battle. In one scene near the end Thomas's behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous. But this is not after all Thomas's film. Murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war. Miller is charming and pathetic as the wife. And Knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably her finest performance. And in every respect the film is worthy of her.",1
"Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? Firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Stephen King rip-off. At one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter Jack claims that Carol the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing is as annoying as ""a gherkin in a burger"". I would be laughing if I was making it up-BUT I'M NOT! Just as ludicrous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. A cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid. WHAT????????<br /><br />Secondly for a horror movie it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. This may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark broad daylight. Not very atmospheric at all.<br /><br />Thirdly the acting is truly awful Pinion proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable. Jeff Fahey is obviously on auto-pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a woe-ful Humphry Bogart impersonation as Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We get the joke it just isn't funny). Credit should go to Susan Paterno an actress I was not aware of she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other more experienced actors to shame.<br /><br />At no point is it even explained how the HUMAN character can understand what Van Husen's character is saying to her. She obviously has some sort of degree in screwy alien languages.<br /><br />On the plus side one moment is well done the car crash involving Susan. The sfx are throughly believable and if it weren't for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been applauded.<br /><br />All I can say about darkhunters is that British horror will never recover from its interminable slump if movies like this continue to be made and shown. Avoid this movie like the plague although the plague would be a lot more scary.<br /><br />Darkhunters 0/5<br /><br />p.s. the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious. It is a weak defence when some claim ""you didn't like it because you didn't understand it"". The letters after my name make a fool of you not me.",0
"Where do I begin? I sat down ready to laugh a bit and I was blown away! This movie is just perfect it's indescribable. Jackass Number Two in all honesty was grosser more obscene funnier and more entertaining than the first. This was just what I needed tonight.<br /><br />There are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say ""Oh My! No Way!"" or ""Ouch!"". Perfectly mastered and set up each event and scene were coordinated way before and therefore made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I'm just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor particular footage in order to prevent an NC-17 rating! It was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway! Amazingly good.<br /><br />9/10. Incredibly funny Do Not Miss Out!",1
Where do I begin? I first saw this film in 1995 and had no idea of what to expect I was actually at the time searching out films that Elijah Wood had starred in and this one had come highly recommended. I sat down and watched the film once and didn't know what to think. I watched it a second time a few days later and the floodgates just opened. Never before in my life had I ever really cried while watching a film and I was blubbing every high and low the film I was riding right alongside on an emotional roller coaster.<br /><br />It struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels the intense sadness and elation we see in the film the wonder and innocence of childhood the yearning for a time that once was but is no more. More than anything this film reminded me of my childhood (except for the abuse) during a time in my life when I'd shrugged off my childhood some years before and not even really noticed I'd given it up and moved on to a life entirely devoid of it. The Radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realise what I'd given up without really even noticing. From that day forward I immediately set about to change my life and myself and I did.<br /><br />This is going to sound corny but basically I rediscovered my inner child I started down a path that has been ongoing over the past 6 years and has changed me so much so much for the better embracing and living that part of myself. I've been finding out who I really am. I don't think it was simply a case of the right film coming along at a crucial moment of my life The Radio Flyer really did something very special and I still look upon it as an incredible piece of work in all respects an incredible film.<br /><br />In closing I cannot fail to mention the music. I am a great fan of Hans Zimmer and this is among his very finest works. The sheer breadth and depth of emotional expression he has put into the score of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is to me. Like subtitles to a foreign language film his soaring music is a crib sheet to the intense emotions this film will take you through. Find the soundtrack at all costs it was sadly deleted long ago I never expected to find it but amazingly did after chatting with someone I met on a Hans Zimmer fansite guest book.<br /><br />Watch this film let yourself live the emotions don't get bogged in trivial nitpicking of the ending be that child again,1
When you think of golf movies you think of Caddyshack but what if there are kids around? Go right to this movie! Disney uses is proved formula to make a movie that the adults and the kids will enjoy. The acting in this movie in my opinion is quite good and the leading cast for the most part is very young! This movie is also suprsingly filmed very well and unique seeing all the angles of the golf game. I think this movie should be up for some academy awards for film editing or something like that because the entire flow of the film is top notch. Though the ending might be a little predictable the movie does well on its own! It also shows that you do not need swearing nudity or violence to make a great golf movie!,1
"When the word ""presents"" finds its way into a title preceded by a famous name the work is usually immediately dismissible. For some reason people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. However I've always been willing to give the second installment of the Demons trilogy a try. For one thing the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. Most American directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of Demons 2. For another well two words: Asia Argento. (Of course she was eleven when this film was made and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early Helen Mirren: steamy looks and little clothing.) As well Lamberto Bava comes from one of Italy's finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as Giallo (he's the son of Mario Bava who may well have invented the genre in the sixties). And the original Demons is an absolute must-see for fans of eighties B-horror films. So how bad can this be right? Well bad. The demons continue their assault on Italian media as the movie opens in a modern Italian high-rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background. They're all watching a kind of combination news report/mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film (which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film). Through the usual horror-film extra inability to concentrate the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life and he comes through the TV screen to start the plague anew.<br /><br />Yeah. It's that bad. About the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack (when you're not being buffeted about by the likes of The Smiths The Cult Gene Loves Jezebel etc.) is stunning. It comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell who got his start as a part of the Argento Dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as Lord of Illusions and Hackers.<br /><br />Makes a half-decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was. Cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty-creature romp Shivers (aka They Came From Within) is a whole lot better.",0
When the Legends Die is a powerful moving story of an orphaned Ute Indian who goes on to become Tom Black Bull a champion bronc rider. Raised in the old ways Tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. Bitter about the role he has been forced into Tom finds fulfillment doing one thing busting horses riding them to death in the rodeo. The movie has Richard Widmark in the role of Red the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story which is about where the movie ends. The real story is completely ignored the dark side of Tom Black Bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas. Oh well you should read the book this movie doesn't come close to doing the story justice.,0
"When na√Øve young Eddie Hatch a window dresser at Savory's Department Store falls for a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss Venus steps off her pedestal and gives Eddie more than he bargained for. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do to a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first-rate songs. The purpose was to make a safe popular movie without too much investment while capitalizing on Ava Gardner's upward mobility to super stardom. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in a thankless role. Eddie's not just naive but dithering and hapless. Gardner is gorgeous but the only things that give the movie any life are Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving but jealous girl friend Tom Conway as the suave owner of Savory's and Eve Arden as Savory's long time wise cracking secretary. It's a role Arden could play in her sleep and she's good at it. <br /><br />The musical opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Martin a big-time star. The only point of a musical however is to have music. Since One Touch of Venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts Kurt Weill composing and Ogden Nash writing the lyrics came up with a series of stylish witty songs and one masterpiece. Without the satire or the clever songs or Martin (or an equivalent showstopper) the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death. <br /><br />Not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the Weill/Nash songs they brought in the movie's music director Ann Ronell to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived turning sharp observation into lovey-dovey romance. Ronell was no hack; she wrote Willow Weep for Me. Wonder what she thought about while she replaced or tweaked Ogden Nash's clever work. <br /><br />The one bright spot in the movie is that Weill/Nash masterpiece. ""Speak Low"" is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote. It's given one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments by Eileen Wilson dubbing Gardner. Dick Haymes contributes a chorus. <br /><br />As for Ann Ronell she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a major music director as well as composer and lyric writer. Yours for a Song: The Women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business including Ronell Kay Swift Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who would like to hear what little of the Weill/Nash score was recorded by the original Broadway cast you might be able to track down the CD One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast). The music is paired with Lute Song another Broadway show that starred Martin.",0
"When i went to see this i thought i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. WRONG! There was NO suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs! When i was done watching this i had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This movie was going through ""the motions."" i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it.",0
When I was growing up Voyage into Space was my most favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters watched it every single day! I still remember every part of that movie. The ending was so sad when Giant Robot got blown up along with Guillotine and then watching Johnny Sokko with all the tears running down his face calling for Giant Robot. There should have been a sequel to the movie in which Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can't believe that there are so many other Voyage into Space fans still out there. I really want to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD but my sister said that the ones out there now are bootlegged and probably bad quality copies of the movie. I don't know why they haven't released it yet since it's been over 40 years now. I think Voyage into Space was made back in 1968. Only now my second favorite Japanese monster movie of all time (The War of the Gargantuas) is finally coming to DVD and being released on Sept. 9th and I can't wait! :) Now if only they would do the same with Voyage into Space. Giant Robot Johnny Sokko and Voyage into Space will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others too it will always be a childhood classic to me! :),1
"When I heard there was to be an ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] mini-series based on life in Changi [WWII POW] camp... with a focus on ""elements of comedy"" I was deeply sceptical and somewhat critical.<br /><br />My father had served in the second world war. Such was the barbarity of the Japanese he was able to talk about the horrors in and around Labuan (where he was stationed) until only quite recently. Along with my father I had been awarded the fortune of knowing many great men (of stronger character and spirit than I shall ever have) who had witnessed acts of unspeakable barbarity at the hands of the Empire of Japan and had never completely recovered. The name 'Changi' is destined to conjure horrific images for ages to come...<br /><br />But upon viewing I was highly impressed with the cast the characters and the complex plot-lines of this wonderful series. I now regard 'Changi' as the highlight of my week (bear in mind I have viewed only three episodes so far... I hope the remaining episodes adhere to the standards set by the first three).<br /><br />The black humour works uncannily well (however the flatulence jokes are a little overdone) and while much of the horror has been suppressed the series comes quite close in relaying the undaunted spirit of the survivors who were able to later continue with their lives in spite of the inhibiting memories.<br /><br />The 'flashback' format of this series will be difficult for some to follow<br /><br />but I can not think of no better way to do adequate justice to the men who suffered deep emotional scarring proceeding internment... when painfully suppressed experiences are remembered sometimes years after the horror.<br /><br />One of the darkest chapters of the Second World War the 20th century and (I would go so far as to say) in the history of mankind is being relayed to a new generation through this series and I hope it serves to relay the overwhelming adversity borne by the wartime generation.<br /><br />Proceeding 'Changi' I don't think I shall ever be able to listen to the poignant tune 'on the road to Gundagai' in the same way again. Tune in...",1
When I first saw this show I was 9 and it caught my attention right away when Stewie was trying to call Lois on the phone in the hotel. I laughed and kept on watching. When the episode was finished i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. This separates itself from the Simpsons and other shows on say Cartoon Network because the jokes are more mature not too much but it's TV-14 for a reason. The quick film cuts after each punch line and cute funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special. Talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show. A good theme song and a crazy family that there's always something funny makes this my favorite cartoon along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check it out it's funny stuff.,1
"When i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another Disney movie that almost goes straight to video. I finally got around and rented it. I thought it was going to be bad because i couldn't see Shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show ""Even Stevens"". When i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. It started a bit slow and i couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that. All and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it. The cast was top notch and even though i'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot.",1
When I first heard that the subject matter for Checking Out was a self orchestrated suicide party my first thought was how morbid tasteless and then a comedy on top of that. I was skeptical. But I was dead wrong. I totally loved it. The cast the funny one liners and especially the surprise ending. Suicide is a delicate issue but it was handled very well. Comical yes but tender where it needed to be. Checking Out also deals with other common issues that I believe a lot of families can relate with and it does with tact and humor. I highly recommend Checking Out. A MUST SEE. I look forward to its release to the public.,1
"When at the very start of the film Paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the Argyle family's house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller; an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around. But as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably.<br /><br />""Ordeal by Innocence"" is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment. Nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (wether you guessed or not).<br /><br />Donald Sutherland Cristopher Plummer Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from her good performance in ""Ryan's Daughter"") just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either.<br /><br />You won't miss much if you skip this one.",0
What is he supposed to be? He was a kid in the past... and the future? This movie had a lot of problems. Is he a ghost or just a strong kid. Man... what a piece of crap. I'm still confused. Also is he supposed to be an abortion? Strange. Very strange. This movie will mess with your mind... and it's not very scary... just confusing. Why was he... Where did...

"What if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot?<br /><br />Well I think it would probably end up a little bit like this one. I don't think I've ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed (at the beginning) to complete crap (by the end). I only stuck with it because I kept thinking it couldn't possibly get worse. Well up until the very end ""Necrophagus""/""Graveyard of Horror"" proved me wrong.<br /><br />Who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard-man evil grave-robbing cultists and mad scientists tossed in for no discernible reason could suck this bad? One would think there'd at least be some humor value... but not here.",0
What can I say? The little kid inside has always had great affections for the following...giant robots giant monsters and a cackling megalomaniacal lead villain and this movie delivers on all counts. As an adult it's easy to point out the many flaws in this film and to say hey it's really only a bunch of episodes taken from a children's TV series strung together. Despite all of this I find the ending very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature. Tremendous Fun if a little nonsensical at times.,1
"What a crazy film!It lasts 12(!) hours and you don't understand who these people are and what are they doing!The main plot is about a bunch of clueless actors trying to bring on scene ""Prometheus""but there are lots of sub-plotslike the disappearing of Thomas and a crazy guy looking for Monsieur Warok....what's the meaning of all this???",1
"We've all see the countless previews and trailers. If you enjoyed Knoxville getting flipped by the Bull you'll take great carnal pleasure in the opening ""act"". I must caution the masses however I considered taking my (under-18) son with me but am relieved I did not. This compilation of obnoxious skits contains a few that albeit as hilarious as they may seem to the adult community a few are not for the immature. These guys must get paid a great ransom to tolerate some of the devious stunts sometimes played at their expense. In particular Bam Margera and Ehren McGhehey are slighted by the group in a few particular stunts. Enjoy",1
Welsh poet Dylan Thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in Whitehall.<br /><br />Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance. Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran who had shot up his house and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with.<br /><br />The real story of this film is the love of two women one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys) the second (Sienna Miller) who is Thomas's wife. At times it reminds of The Singing Detective as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity.,1
Well...I like this movie first of all because it's very well thought of... and well..because the um...director and others chose an extremely great actor to play Mike....and also my last reason because ( my opinion) Elijah Wood is so so hot!!!,1
"Well made documentary focusing on two Sudanese refugees who get resettled in the United States. It's your basic fish out of water story with a non-fiction twist. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived prior to coming to America and how they adapted once they arrived here (in Houston Texas.) They expected a sort of heaven but found out that it's a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states. They go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Everywhere they go they meet bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens may take for granted. They fret that they are blacker than the African-Americans here and don't feel accepted because of that. One of the ""Lost Boys"" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe Kansas where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal. There are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film. Not shown but talked about are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them leading one Lost Boy to comment negatively that ""all black people in America are no good."" I found it interesting too that they arrived in Houston in August 2001 a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but it's not mentioned at all. Still all in all a really well done documentary with no narration. None is needed really. The ""Lost Boys"" do a fine job expounding on the events going on around them without any help at all thank you very much.",1
Well I'll begin with this: I love horror-movies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. Second; this is the worst movie of all times. It even beats Mean Guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes. And for that I pay it homage.<br /><br />However the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad. To my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of C-movie-crap from 7 and up; I KNOW YOU'RE JOKING! GOOD ONE!! HAHAHA! Because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is; you can't be for real.<br /><br />Everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so I'll leave it. <br /><br />MINOR SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />But the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog-kennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me.,0
"Well I have to disagree with Leonard Maltin on this animated short. He loves it and claimed it was hilarious. I enjoyed it but didn't see any humor. He doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story. Living right across the border from Canada I have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in Buffalo....but I didn't think much of this cartoon. Oh it was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Toronto jersey up in the Quebec area - disaster! That especially holds true in the glory years of Les Canadians. However that doesn't make the story funny. <br /><br />Back in the 1950s everyone in the Quebec provinces idolized the Montreal Canadians and their star player Maurice Richard and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new sweater it has the Toronto Maple Leafs emblem on it so the kid doesn't want to be caught dead wearing it.. When he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies. What's so funny about that? I could see the same thing happening to a kid in Boston who is Red Sox die-hard and his mom gets him Yankees shirt! Horrors! You couldn't wear it and vice-versa.<br /><br />Maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all like Maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to him...but it's a fact of life or any bit-time sports fan and his favorite team. It was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laugh.<br /><br />The art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid. The French Canadian accent was good too. This movie was part of the DVD ""Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada.",1
Wealthy horse ranchers in Buenos Aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the Crawfords of Manhattan but what happens when the mustachioed Latin son falls for a certain Crawford with bright eyes blonde hair and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th Century-Fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. It is very heavy on the frenetic gymnastic-like dancing exceedingly thin on story. Betty Grable (an eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) gives it a boost even though she's paired with leaden Don Ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as Betty's pithy aunt a limousine driver who's constantly asleep on the job and Carmen Miranda playing herself (who else?). The stock shots of Argentina far outclass the action filmed on the Fox backlot and some of the supporting performances are quite awful. By the time of the big horserace finale most viewers will have had enough. *1/2 from ****,0
"Way back at the dawn of human civilization cavemen sat around and made lame jokes hit each other over the heads with what ever they could grab and women were never seen and apparently at one time had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse region with a cockatoo a camel a monkey - but no women. This film tells of the ""hilarious"" misadventures of seven(or so) cavemen - having burned their land with the new discovery of fire - moving on by water to a new land where they find this woman with the extra appendage. Along the way we get such ""great"" moments of comedy like a fat cavemen swallowing a frog that keeps croaking in his stomach. A monkey throwing rocks at their heads. A man swallowing a mouse to get the frog in his stomach. The obligatory ""gay"" caveman. The list could go on and on. This movie is the very definition of cinematic dreck. I was bored from the onset and it only got worse as the cavemen bobbled around hitting each other making poor jokes such as puns on the word perch hitting each other and mauling poor Seta Berger who looks like she lost a bet to a producer to appear in this nonsense. She is indeed one of two bright spots in this film. She isn't much of an actress so you have to guess why she is an ass-et? The other ""bright"" spot is the music. As soon as I heard the score I said to myself that it sounded very familiar. I had never heard the actual score but the music was unmistakably that of Ennio Morricone. It's a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise crude boring lewd unimaginative and ridiculous film essentially about a group of Moes finding a woman for the first time and first wanting to eat her like some animal being taught what she could do. Awwwwh! Sorry I'm stifling a yawn as I relive the plot! The end of the film has some 100 or so mostly naked women on screen with all the erotic feel of pulling a scab off your knee. This movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever. The fact that it spawned a sequel doesn't surprise me as it offers that one thing which will prick viewer interest - tail.",0
Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre some dead bodies signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.<br /><br />The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes. Catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century England built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith. Not something you see in westerns but a good gimmick.<br /><br />Unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought Wayne to this place exactly. But this was a B western and not even a good one at that.<br /><br />Gabby Hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the garrulous Gabby.<br /><br />If you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless Gabby Hayes then see this film.,0
Walt was particularly fond of quality. So how come the producers at Disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted (even for family fare!) mess of a movie? THE BIG GREEN had a good concept. And since it is Disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously. But THE BIG GREEN is horrible. The jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resume.<br /><br />Kids with too much time on their hands in small town Elma are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer. The kids don't know a thing though. And gracious for us we get to see Steve Guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end.<br /><br />The speed up camera work does not work. THE BIG GREEN is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along. Kids are not idiots. They will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage. Guttenburg for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie. Also the pretty Olivia d'Abo should have called this one off too. THE BIG GREEN can be known as 'The Big Bomb.',0
"Veteran TV director Ted Post treats us to a plodding confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from Column B of the Harold Robbins Big Book Of Plots. Set against a smoggy Phoenix skyline post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a star turn as ""the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times"" while JFK impersonator James Franciscus lounges around the fringes. <br /><br />Mannix goes western monkeys are abused models lean against classic cars and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.<br /><br />Oh yeah and Bob Mitchum is in there too. Somewhere.",0
"Venice in 1596.Jews are separated from the good Christians.Bassanio a young but poor Venetian loves the fair Portia who is a wealthy heiress.So he approaches his friend a merchant called Antonio for three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont and propose Portia.All of Antonio's ships and merchandise are busy at sea so he turns to the moneylender Shylock the one of Jewish faith.Shylock does not like Antonio for he spat on his face.He offers Antonio a three-month loan at no interest but if he will not pay the money in that time he will own a pound of his flesh.Also Shylock's daughter Jessica elopes with the Christian Lorenzo.The Merchant of Venice is based on William Shakespeare's play that's believed to have written between 1596 and 1598.I read the play last summer and now I've seen the movie made in 2004 by Michael Radford.I liked the play and I don't quite agree with the accusations of it being anti-Semitic.The Jewish character does not appear as an inhuman monster even though he's ready to cut a piece of Antonio's flesh.There's a lot of depth in his character which all comes out in his speech where he asks ""If you prick us do we not bleed?"" and so forth.There is much more human in Shylock's character than in one of Antonio's who spits on the good Jew.Al Pacino is unbeatable as Shylock.He gives such a strong performance.Jeremy Irons is also terrific as Antonio.Lynn Collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of Portia.Zuleikha Robinson does great job as Jessica and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good.Kris Marshall plays Gratiano and he does a good job.In the role of Nerissa we see Heather Goldenhersh.Mackenzie Crook plays Launcelot Gobbo.As in Shakespeare plays usually also this one contains most brilliant dialogue.The movie paints a fantastic portray of the era.It deals with some great issues in a Shakespearian way.",1
Unfortunately I went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information I had seen on Fandango. Since I am a sci-fi buff the notion of a movie about UFOs interested me.<br /><br />Instead this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical Christian propaganda flick. Appropriate for an audience of like-minded individuals but very un-Christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least the Da Vinci Code did not hold back its wild-eyed craziness.<br /><br />So this B-grade movie (and I am being kind) production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs probably shown to Wednesday and Sunday evening youth groups. But if you are a mainline Christian or non-Christian you will not be comfortable.,0
"Uhhh ... so did they even have writers for this? Maybe I'm picky but I like a little dialog with my movies. And as far as slasher films go just a sliver of character development will suffice.<br /><br />Unfortunately The Prey provides neither¬óand if you think I'm being hyperbolic you'll just have to see it for yourself. Scene after scene we just get actors standing around looking forlorn and awkward abandoned by any sense of a script. Outside of calling out each other's names when they get separated in the woods (natch) the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation Orion (clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls; scintillating slasher fare no?) and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesn't even have anything to do with the plot (wait what IS the plot?) At other times The Prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we can't exactly hear what they're saying. So we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring! Deliberately! Seriously I've seen more dialog in a silent film. It's as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga in the heyday of the '80s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said ""Hey I gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag. Let's somehow pad an entire feature around it."" And ... well they did. <br /><br />To be fair The Prey probably had some sort of writer on board. I mean somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies. However I am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever. There are glaring pauses boring tableaux and zero sense of pacing throughout. The filmmakers don't have anything else in the ""script"" to film so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced. These critters are all filmed in straightforward noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography. If it feels like a science film that's because it is. I'm pretty sure this is all nature show stock footage¬óall that's missing is a stuffy narration from some National Geographic alderman.<br /><br />More exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor: a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute-and-a- half! A minute-and-a-half! That's a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with let alone insert into the final cut of the film! Way to go guys! Brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfest.<br /><br />Admittedly the film picks up quite a bit of steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip-off of B√©la Bart√≥k's ""Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta"" cuts in. Vaudeville great Jackie Coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby bumbly park ranger (this was his last role if you can believe it). And there are some nice gory moments including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation. The make-up used for the killer (Carel Struycken aka ""Lurch"" from the Addams Family movies) is also quite effective and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Plus if you love wacky straight-outta-left-field endings you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up. You'll do a spit take I promise.<br /><br />Usually I love films that are on this level of ineptitude but the first three-quarters of The Prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest. Overall this is a largely pallid and tedious affair and while it ain't all bad it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists. Why do we do this to ourselves anyway?",0
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out. Instead the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity.,0
"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird locations too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36"" inseam is tall & slender & a size 5 I am more average at a size 12. We would like to see both- I can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it it will not fit the same way on me. I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. Thank you.",0
Typically elaborately crafted HBO production with a first-rate cast a rich small-town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes graced by above average production values.<br /><br />But and that's a huge 'but' the various subplots peopled with some likable mostly annoying caricatures are paper-thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours.<br /><br />The often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama without being entertaining enough and personal drama without being profound at all.<br /><br />A shame because some scenes really shine. Two or three that is.<br /><br />4 out of 10 grubby Paul Newmans,0
"Two years after this movie was made ""The Juror"" came out. Don't waste your time on this one. See ""The Juror"" instead. ""The Juror"" is essentially the same story as ""Trial By Jury"" with better acting better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. William Hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad and Armand Assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. You didn't become involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her. Also the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn't compelling or interesting in any way. Kathleen Quinlan's role as a hooker/killer wasn't fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot.",0
True there are some goofs for the one who wants to find them. They're not important though.<br /><br />The primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman but one who has been hurt. Same for Harrison Ford who for the ladies is just as beau as Kristin is belle for us guys.<br /><br />Their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an awkward manner but one in which they find support in each other. How they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. The viewer cannot help but feel what they feel nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together.<br /><br />Yes there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops but they only spice it up a little and are not a significant part of the movie.<br /><br />For the lover of music Dave Grusin provides a superb Jazz based background featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business. Blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene.<br /><br />Not a movie for the lovers of guts blood and gore. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside watch a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act like Harrison Ford to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard this is a move to watch with someone you love. Preferably in bed.<br /><br />I thought it deserved at least an 8.,1
Tokyo Eyes tells of a 17 year old Japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop. This lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk talk and more talk. You'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus talk and play video games talk and get a haircut talk and walk and walk and talk talk on cell phones hang out and talk etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen. The thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value a meager cast and no action no romance no sex or nudity no heavy drama...just incessant yadayadayada'ing. (C-),0
"To understand ""Crash Course"" in the right context you must understand the 80's in TV. Most TV shows didn't have any point. The sitcom outpopulated the drama at least 3 to 1. They were still figuring out where the lines were so that they could cross them. (TV Shows like ""Hail to the Chief"" was quite the bold step!) This made-for-TV movie ""Crash Course"" featured an All-Star cast bringing together members from all the 80's classics: ""227"" ""Family Ties"" ""Who's the Boss?"" et al. Directors must've had a certain penchant for those all-star movies then. Still this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity. And that's not bad sometimes. Viva Soleil Moon Frye.",1
To summarize my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes plot inconsistencies untied loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. I found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from Jurassic Park 1. The editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling. In short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpoint<br /><br />Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I really enjoyed the pterodactyls.) We got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action.<br /><br />As a scientist and former childhood paleontologist the lack of any real scientific content (not that it had to be realistic but logically formed i.e. how they built the dinos in #1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) was disappointing as well.<br /><br />In short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money. I hope that movie-goers don't fall for this trap again (although I did apparently),0
Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach Ian Charleson Urbano Barberini Daria Nicolodi Review: The only other Argento movie I had seen was Suspiria and that one blew me away with its style colors and spooky story line. I next decided to go with Opera as I had been told it was one of his best. Man I think I'm discovering what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors.<br /><br />Opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break when the main star of a creepy modern opera take on Mc Beth gets hit by a car. Betty is the understudy so she gets to do the part herself. Too bad for her there's a psycho after her who makes her watch the brutal murders of her friends and co-workers.<br /><br />Wow Id heard good things about this here flick but I wasn't prepared for the level of greatness to which this film would take me. Yeah the movie has its shortcomings to which Ill get to later. But for the most part the movie blew me away.<br /><br />First off this movie is not as filled with lots of colors as Suspiria. I was expecting it to be a bit like suspiria in that department but no to my surprise it had its own look and feel. The film is somehow devoid of color. It does have lots in colors in certain scenes (like the masterful kitchen/living room sequence) where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues but for the most part the film has a grayish black tone to it all through out and I liked that it had its own distinctive look.<br /><br />The real stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated death sequences. Wow. Every death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just your typical hack and slash death sequences these deaths were carefully constructed to shock and get the most out of its situations. Loved every second of them there's plenty of blood and mayhem here but with style. Not gonna spoil em though.<br /><br />Then there's the direction. Man there's some really original and beautiful shots on this one. I loved the inventive use of the camera on this one. You thought that Tarantinos shot in Kill Bill vol. 1 where we see the bullet coming out of the chamber of the gun was original? Well this is the movie he lifted it from! I honestly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this specific movie with certain scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in the making of feature he mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver coming to kill her was influenced by Italian Giallos and here my friends is the proof of that. Anyhows Tarantino references aside this movie has some amazing camera shots like those scenes of the crows flying through the crowd in the opera house...great stuff. And a main reason why Argentos becoming one of my favorites.<br /><br />The acting from most of the cast was alright but the best by far was Cristina Marsillach as the tortured young opera singer Betty. The looks in her eyes as the murders were being committed were great. The rest of the cast was a little wooden and stiff but nothing that would deter your enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />There were very few things I didn't like about this movie. First off logic was thrown out the window in certain scenes. Specially those involving Bettys reactions after shes seen the murders. It seem to me that for the longest time she just went on about her business not telling anyone about the whole thing. Not even the police. I mean if you see someone brutally murder a loved one in front of your eyes...you don't just walk away from the murder scene and continue with your life. Someone would have connected her to the murders. She might have even become a suspect herself...but no. Also the ending is a bit anti climactic. You'll have to see this to understand but it seemed a bit unnecessary the way the film ended it felt like it could have ended earlier. It would not have felt so redundant. But thats about it not real big problems for me really since I was enjoying the rest of this beautiful film.<br /><br />I've still got a lot of Argento territory to cover...but I'm devouring every step of the way like if I was eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. This guys really good. I think of his films as works of art and I've only seen two of em! Cant wait to discover the rest of his films. Argento you the man! <br /><br />Rating: 41/2 out of 5,1
Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. There are of course complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. One late exchange where Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery. There are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the microphones. Its not a bad film its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. Normally I'm forgiving but this time out I just couldn't go with the flow (Then again the copy I saw was absolutely horrible). Worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong),0
Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. The three businessmen take revenge which escalates to a murder after another. Supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people.<br /><br />The plot has too many holes. The details were ignored in order to move the story forward. The acting was uneven. The color balance was awful even though I watched this movie in DVD. The small budget and tight schedule were apparent. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight and the ending was just unbelievable.,0
This would probably be a good film to see....provided you've already seen every other film in existence and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you. God this movie was unbelievably insipid with some of the worst (or is it nonexistent) writing ever captured on film. There is no saving grace to this film; even the animatronics are kind of lame and it's just a complete waste of time and money.<br /><br />Run. Fast. It's beyond horrible.<br /><br />,0
This would have to be by far the greatest series I have ever seen. I vividly watched every sunday night and purchased the box set as soon as it was available. this is a timeless play written by a fantastic Australian that people of all ages could relate to whether they are Australian or not however for those of us that are Australian it truly brings across the typical Australian icon. A must see 10/10,1
"This wonderfully witty comedy-drama wowed the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival whipping them into wild applause at its conclusion. Buttressed by adept performances by a nuanced cast sturdy execution by director Jeff Hare a brisk pace and one of Peter Falk's best performances in years the film emerges as a loving homage to the highs and woes of family life.<br /><br />Falk excels as Jewish ninetysomething Morris Applebaum a wildly eccentric Shakespearean thespian who decides to end his life but not before rounding up his three grown children and throwing a ""big fat Jewish suicide party."" The film brims with indelible delights. There's Morris's ""tushy room""; Laura San Giacomo's passionate rendering of Morris's cynical daughter; rapid-fire comedic dialogue that recalls the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the wry timing of David Paymer who plays Morris's tightly wound psychotherapist son; and Morris's patented egg creams (but be careful drinking them too fast will cause a nasty brain freeze). It's all enveloped in a feel-good intimate atmosphere set in New York City.<br /><br />Director Jeff Hare proves to be a master craftsman drawing out memorable performances from his cast and lending the film a mirthful humanity. I was fortunate to see an earlier film by Hare: the dark and powerful ""Perfect Little Man"" starring Neal McDonough (""Minority Report"") as a Los Angeles man spiraling into madness. The visceral grit of ""Perfect"" and the nostalgic breeze of ""Checking Out"" are a testament to Hare's eclecticism and wide-ranging talent. I'm looking forward to checking out his future work.<br /><br />I heard ""Checking Out"" lacks a distributor at this point. Some wise company would do well to pick up this crowd-pleasing gem for it's a potential box-office titan in the vein of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" Most nobly it would give people around the world a chance to experience the joys of this movie.",1
"this was a thoughtful and well-shot and directed TV movie that took on a huge subject with precision and intelligence and gives it a film treatment that would look great on a bigger screen -- the palette is a little muted for TV. if you're looking for a war action film or ""bosnia lite"" this isn't for you -- it's about an ordinary woman who took on an extraordinary challenge for humanity. if you want to learn more about the conflict and how the work of one woman influenced the world in a massive way watch this film when it comes your way. i don't see that a lot of other TV films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. the story avoids obvious demonization of ""the bad guys"" and instead shows the denial and everyday hatred that resulted in deaths of thousands. i was moved at several points and not in some manipulative Hollywood way with driving music and flashy mise-en-scene but allowed to discover the horror and implications along with the characters. this is a film brave enough to let the content speak for itself and keep the visuals understated to support it with dignity.<br /><br />the actors do a helluva job at bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life. the scenes where victims give their testimony before the war tribunal are powerful and Wendy Crewson Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is awful -- no one else has given him a chance to play a Brit and when he finally has it he blows it! -- and although John Corbett's body was born to play a soldier/commando he's a little too gee-whiz nice although he does a good job.",1
This was a really interesting Halloween film. I wasnt to thrilled with the whole Thorn theory but it still makes for a good film. I liked getting to see Tommy Doyle back but sadly Donald Pleasance died right after shooting. The film had a really REALLY bad director who didnt give a flip about the series from what I heard treated Donald bad and wouldnt let Danielle Harris come back as Jamie. Its like he was just trying to bring down the film but I still liked it. There were alot of cuts and music changes and if you're lucky you can get the Producers Cut which features over 40 min. of never before scenes. With those scenes it turns into a whole new movie. Check it out if you have the chance.,1
this was a get up and go horror movie with an intelligent cast and a director with great vision to really capture the mood of the story i highly recommend this movie,1
This video has heartfelt memories. It has a great cast and all the actors did a great job. I have been searching to buy this video. If anybody knows of where I can purchase please e-mail me. I really want to add this to my collection.,1
this took me back to my childhood in the 1950 's so corny but just fab no one ever could play FLASH GORDON like LARRY BUSTER CRABBE just great. i have two more series to view flash gordon's trip to mars and flash gordon conquers the universe cannot wait<br /><br />,1
"This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers.<br /><br />Written and directed by Julian Fellowes who won an Oscar for writing ""Gosford Park"" (this is his directorial debut) from a novel by Nigel Balchin it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. However it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson (the adulterous wife) and Rupert Everett (the highly amoral high-class totty) are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye.",0
"This story is an excellent tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father. ""Lord of the Rings"" star Elijah Wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role. This movie is one of the main reasons I haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as I live. That might make me sound like a nerd but that's what I have to say. It is a wonder why this isn't hearld as a classic American tale.",1
This show is made for persons with IQ lower than 80. The jokes in the show are so lame. If you are on a deserted island and you do not have anything to do you will be better than to watch this garbage.... You will hate their accent their behavior and all the stupid jokes and pranks they try to perform...It really pisses me of that viewers gave Reba 6.7 on their voting...Sure i knew there are some people with IQ lower than 80 but what i did not know that there are so many of them! So people if you got to read this I hope that you will never ever download or buy this peace of garbage... I know it is not the place for his but i wish to recommend one much better mini-series 'Scrubs',0
This show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch. The stories are a little slow for adults but they are still good. There are lots of children in my family boys and girls and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the Mystic Knights. It is a wonderful show and I hope that they will continue to keep making it. All of the kids in my family and myself think that Vincent Walsh is the best of them all. We have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing a great job. We wish all of the actors actresses writers directors and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work.,1
This short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life. When he learns why that's not a good idea we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he's been lecturing on.,1
This sequel is brilliant and is the last film Donald Pleasance (Dr.Loomis) worked on before his death. I loved the new direction the film took with the story instead of just Michael Myers wanting to kill his family. I love this whole series and apart from the first and second movies this is by far the best.,1
This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.<br /><br />Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. We then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. The writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. For instance Model Behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew; Falling in Lust Again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel; She's the Boss is about a put-upon male secretary/dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. All the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. Even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. The sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. The camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. Finally the end credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel Singer Island Florida although my map of Florida shows no Singer Island. The scenery certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a UK DVD release. 4 stars.,0
This review is based on the Producer's Cut: <br /><br />'Halloween 5' was a major disappointment at the box office way back in '89. Personally I've always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection. But because of it's failure and also because of rights issues it would be 6 years before we would see another installment. The film had the makings of being one of the best if not the best in the series. A hardcore fan writing the script the return of not only Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers but also the return of the character of Tommy Doyle from the first film a major studio backing the project and a Fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making. So what went wrong? I'll give you two good reasons: Re-shoots and poor editing. Due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of Donald Pleasence the film was changed and not for the better. The film like parts III and 5 tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans. But then thanks to the magic of bootlegging the original cut leaked out and many fans including my self were very happy. I will end this portion of my review by saying this: This film is so far at least my favorite 'Halloween' film and I'm not afraid to admit that.<br /><br />Pros: The score is simply spellbinding. Has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series. 'Halloween 4' emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts and 6 is the same way. Great performances especially from the late and very missed Donald Pleasence. Moves at a breathtaking pace. An interesting explanation for Michael's evil and why he won't die. Some brutal kills. Some pretty chilling moments my favorite being the one involving Kim Darby's character. A lot of really cool nods to the previous films. Some good surprises. Like the previous two sequels this one has an awesome cliffhanger ending.<br /><br />Cons: Though the explanation for Michael's evil is fascinating it does make him a little less scary. Since when can Michael move around from place to place so fast? <br /><br />Final thoughts: This was the first 'Halloween' that I saw in the theatre. I was so excited because I really had thought 5 would be the last and then I heard this was happening. I enjoyed it at the time but over time I saw it for what it really was: A great movie trapped in an OK one with a terrible ending. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings? If they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess it's in right now.<br /><br />My rating: 5/5,1
This review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box. So if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it except that I like it a lot stop here...<br /><br />The production values are not first rate but the acting between the leads is and they give the romance between them more life than Shute does in his novel (although I generally prefer the novel). My very faint objections to the film as opposed to the book is that the film dumbs-down some of the relationships with secondary characters and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device. All this is handled much better in the book with the result that I find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie.,1
"this really is an ""okay"" series.. everyone in it is pretty good. but i just can't take Reba. she's trying to be funny but she just isn't and then she got a stupid accent!! if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day..<br /><br />i have been watching the show in 10 min now and as i said before Reba IS destroying the show. however the 20 year old guy (dont know his name) but he's soooo funny and he's really saving it all..<br /><br />so here's the recipe to get a great show. kick Reba of it and then put the 20 year old guy into the lead role.<br /><br />i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should kick Reba of the show and put someone else in the lead role",0
This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980 starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. If you like pictures like this you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com,0
"This one's a doozy. Dating from 1949 Scene of the Crime often plays more like a Coen Bros. movie set in the 1940's and filmed in black and white except that the writer's ear for pastiche here isn't quite so well-tuned -- maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to Oscar-baiting schlock like Road to Perdition. Frankly it's a wonder that this film isn't considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated mannerist thrills cloaked in false significance ( much like the grandaddy of all such ""fake art"" films Citizen Kane or anything by Murnau. ) <br /><br />MGM is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes and I think any story any atmosphere even ""gritty realism"" can only benefit from grotesque overaestheticization. You could say I'm a disciple of the Minnelli school. But it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough-guy dialogue of the Dashiell Hammett stripe a willingness perhaps to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like ""Careful Mr. Wiggly or you'll have thirteen fish to fry and no little wormies to catch them with."" I made most of that up -- ""Mr. Wiggly"" unfortunately made the cut -- but believe me the dialogue is just that loonily inflated and riddled with non sequiturs. Even the lead cop's wife played by Arlene Dahl speaks like she has a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the Christian name Rocco. By the time Van Johnson turns in his badge with the line ""I'm sick to death of death and homicide"" you'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary devices -- in this case zeugma -- could ever have been misconstrued as ""street."" <br /><br />For those who have outgrown The Naked Gun series this is the funniest cops-n-robbers film going.",0
"This one of those social dramas that WB knew how to put together and were guaranteed boxoffice hits in the thirties. This early ""dead end kids"" are sent to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney a gangster as part of a deal is appointed as the commissioner of the school. He doesn't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. The idea is to let the boys rule and administer their community. Whether this is sound social reform is beyond my belief but it's a movie. It's a lot like Boys Town with a slight darker tone. A useless happy ending deluges what impact the scene prior hard but is still good. WB would later make this same movies with Bogart in the Cagney/fatherly role.",1
This movies had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my entire life. I laughed so hard i almost puked. After the movie was done i laughed for about an hour just thinking about the very last seen in the movie. Its is definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing all of them back together again. If you are squeamish or don't like raunchy childish humour you will not like this movie. If you can go in with an open mind and not take it so seriously then you will laugh your ass off. Its amazing no one was killed in this movie. Every seen in this movie is so original and so different from the next you will not know what to expect. <br /><br />Mike Webber,1
This movie with all its complexity and subtlety makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen. The topics it addresses are ugly cynical and at times even macabre but the film remains beautiful in its language artful with its camera angles and gorgeous in its style skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories Tobias Wolff.<br /><br />Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie I won't go into any details other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself. It takes pride in what it does and does it well. It shows the most important memories of life all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling: unexpected bliss. This movie of its own volition has created in me the same feelings the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when words transformed his very existence and that is one impressive feat.,1
"This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />It's marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it's nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.<br /><br />It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.<br /><br />Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants hypocrites and war mongers. Let's not forget our bumbling former President actually came out and said that ""God told him"" to invade Iraq. And nobody questioned if he was hearing voices or seeing things? <br /><br />Anyway going of the subject here. No this movie has nothing to do with UFOs whatsoever it's nothing more than a religious production.",0
"This movie was terrible. It is not something that people should have to pay to see. It looks like some Christian group made it to convert people. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to TV.<br /><br />It started out like an old fashioned B movie sci-fi film from the 50s but quickly changed. About 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about ""God"" and ""Do you believe in Jesus?"" It quickly moves into pure religion territory.<br /><br />I thought I was going to a Sci-Fi movie. The film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.<br /><br />AVOID IT!",0
"This movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed on Australia's Special Broadcasting Service. I thought I read here that there is sometimes an assumption that *Revenge of the Rats* is a sequel. In fact the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie or in human history. There is no prequel as far as I know.<br /><br />Now let's get The Pied Piper of Hamelin out of the way. Perhaps this tale crossed my mind when I was watching the film but that's all. There was the use of the word ""coffers"" at the end of the movie. A dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying ""the coffers were empty"". ""Coffers"" isn't a word you hear around much these days unless you read folk tales to your children as I do. Since seeing *Revenge of the Rats* I've read two versions of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. Now I see the comparison. A metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats. This is about as far as I can follow the analogy. The children are not led to a door in a mountain with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains where it is always spring and everyone is always happy.<br /><br />There's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie. The romance and the resolution especially. The female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent. Where this film is quite rebellious (as compared with American cinema) is that it is anti-authoritarian. The helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for ""doing good"". The mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money. Finally it is left to one doctor in Frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease. Apparently there is no national Infectious Diseases authority to co-ordinate things or send in back-up.<br /><br />I'm not a horror aficionado so any horror I do see is usually mingled with humour. Right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers; the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too.",1
"This movie was poorly conceived poorly written and poorly acted. All of the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The movie was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. The Christian characters are holier-than-thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters. The movie was a real ""gotcha"" for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie. I remember another movie on a similar subject ""The Rapture"" starring Mimi Rogers that was much better and professionally done. I think I'll watch ""The Rapture"" again. If you attend ""Unidentified"" and don't like it don't say I haven't warned you.",0
This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. From the opening 10 minutes I was ready to leave. The cliches there slapping you in the face and the plot was not only predictably stupid but full of more holes than swiss cheese. I am considering suing for that lost 2 hours and $6.25 along with the fact that I am now stupider for watching this waste of film. The T-Rex's must be flipping in their graves so to speak.,0
This movie was Hilarious! It occasionally went too far but isn't that what we expect from them? The theater roared with laughter and ooooooed at all the incredibly crazy stunts. It's rude crude and occasionally frighteningly intense. The whole gang is back and even more out of their minds which in turn provides for some great entertainment. I don't want to give anything away but the little snippets of clips going around the net are nothing compared to what comes after. <br /><br />This is a great movie to go see with friends. Try to see it with a big crowd. You will not be disappointed. Just don't go with anyone who can't take it (see above). It will not go over well you can be sure of that. But that's pretty obvious in the first place. If you enjoyed the first one you will loooooove this one.,1
This movie was great and I was waiting for it for a long time. When it finally came out I was really happy and looked forward to a 10 out of 10. It was great and lived up to my potential. The performances were great on the part of the adults and most of the kids. The only bad performance was by Milo himself. There was one problem that I encountered with this (and others like it) movie. All of the characters I wanted to live were getting killed. Overall I give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10. Maybe we should select better people to kill next time though ok?,1
This movie was fun! Especially if your between 8 and 15. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it. Paul Giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to 'get'. My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: No really bad words or any sex to worry about. Recommend it for the 'right' crowd. AP,1
